/**
 * Buffer is reusable [Page] of data that can be _pinned_ to a certain [Block].
 * Buffers are the primary mechanism of caching: [BasicBufferManager] maintains
 * a pool of buffers that the database can then allocate to reduce reads from
 * disk.
 *
 * Buffer may reside in one of three states:
 *
 * 1. It might not be assigned to any block. In this case the buffer has no meaningful
 *    data and is a good candidate to use for anything that needs a buffer.
 * 2. It is _pinned_ to a block. Pinning means that some transaction is actively using
 *    the buffer and we may not use the buffer for other purposes until it is unpinned.
 *    However, multiple transactions may use the buffer to the same block, increasing
 *    the count of pins on the buffer.
 * 3. It might be assigned to a block without being pinned. This means that we are free
 *    to use the buffer for any purpose (i.e. we can assign it to some other block if
 *    needed), but if we need the data for the already assigned block, we're in luck,
 *    since we don't need to reload it from the disk; it suffices to pin the buffer.
 *
 * Finally, if the buffer is modified by a transaction, we store the id of the transaction
 * along with the [LSN] of log so that we can flush the buffer when the transaction commits.
