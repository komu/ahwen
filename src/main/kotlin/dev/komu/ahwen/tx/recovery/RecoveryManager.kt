/**
 * Recovery manager is responsible for implementing commit, rollback and recovery from crashes.
 * The manager will intercept all modifications to data and writes a recovery log that can be used
 * to perform both rollback and recovery.
 *
 * The basic idea behind the recovery log is simple enough: whenever a change is made to a record,
 * we will first write a log entry that will tell us how the change can be undone. Only when the log
 * hits the disk will we write the actual change as well.
 *
 * If we need to recover from crash there are three possible states for each change:
 *
 * 1. Undo-entry was written to disk, but the changed buffer was not written. Executing the undo-entries
 *    will be a no-op, since they will just restore the data to the state that it already is.
 * 2. Both the undo-entry and the changed buffer were written, but the transaction was never committed.
 *    Executing the undo-entries will undo the changes to last committed state.
 * 3. Both the undo-entry and the changed buffer were written and the transaction was later committed.
 *    In this case we won't try to undo the changes.
 *
 * Rollback is similar to recovery: we'll lookup the log for all undo entries relating to the transaction
 * that we want to rollback and execute them.
